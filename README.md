# Event Dispatcher Example

This example demonstrates using *dictionary dispatching* to implement event handlers. Rather than a block of conditional logic (`if/else` statements), I use a dictionary to register, lookup, and invoke event handlers (functions) given a key. This pattern is used by popular Python libraries like Flask and FastAPI to dispatch requests. It is also used by the [functools.singledispatch()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch) decorator to implement function overloading based on the type of the function's first argument.

This example is a simplified version of an event dispatacher I built to register event handlers for events arriving from Kafka in an event-driven architecture. Metadata in each Kafka message (event) includes a key to identify the event type which is then used to dispatch the event to the appropriate handler.
